# SharedContactsApp
This Google Apps Script library provides access to the Shared Contacts of a Google Apps Domain and can only be used by accounts with proper administrative privileges on the domain. 

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/RomainVialard/SharedContactsApp/wiki) on how to make the library work for you.

## Very important!
Your script **must** use old runtime (not V8), else the library will not work.<br>
So if you rely on V8 features for your script, you can currently **not** use this library.

The SharedContactsApp library was created by [Romain Vialard](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/romainvialard) and Peter Herrmann.

## Alternative
If you don't want to build your own app to manage Domain Shared Contacts, you can use this free Sheets addon by 123 Toolkit.<br>
